# Python-Port-Scanner
This Python-based Port Scanner uses Tkinter for a simple GUI to perform TCP SYN scans, detect services (-sV), and identify OS (-O) using Nmap. It includes a progress bar, export to CSV feature, and service/OS detection options, making it a useful tool for network security and analysis.
